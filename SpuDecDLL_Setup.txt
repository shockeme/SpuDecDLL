Install steps for Development Mode:
1. Create "vlc" folder in some work area on your drive.  Actual location is arbitrary.
2. Download the following packages into the "vlc" folder created above.
	download vlc-3.0.4-win32.7z from http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/
		Note:  7z package above appears to be only compressed package that includes SDK, which is needed for compiling the dll
	github.com/shockeme
	https://github.com/shockeme/SpuDecDll.git
	Look for SpuDecDLL and clone it into your c drive OR download the zip of spudecdll
3. Unzip the packages above in the vlc folder.  This should result in 2 folders inside of the vlc folder:
	SpuDecDll-master
	vlc-3.0.4-win32
4. Temp... until we get install package... Copy the FilterFiles folder AND the filter_words.txt file into:
	vlc\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4

Directory Structure Should look like:
|--vlc
	|---SpuDecDll-master
		|---SpuDecDll
			|---Debug <This is where libmovfltr_plugin.dll is created after build>
			|---SpuDecDll.vcxproj <1st time working on project, open this file>
			|---SpuDecDll.sln <Will not exist the first time you open project above>
			|---<files>
		|---SpuDecDLL_Setup.txt <ie. this file>
		|---filter_words.txt <example filter file; copy over to vlc-3.0.4 folder and modify as desired
		|---FilterFiles <Folder that holds example filter files; copy folder over to vlc-3.0.4 folder and modify as desired>
			|---MARVELS_THE_AVENGERS.txt <example filter file; For use with DVD directly>
		|---<files>
	|---vlc-3.04-win32
	        |---vlc-3.0.4
			|---sdk
			|---plugins
				|---codec <This is where libmovfltr_plugin.dll is copied to in post build event>
			|--- vlc.exe <This is THE vlc executable (for development purposes)>
			|--- FilterFiles <Folder that contains all skip and other filter files; copied manually for now>
				|--- MARVELS_THE_AVENGERS.txt <example name of filter file; name must match name of DVD>
			|--- filter_words.txt <Contains all words/phrases to be filter, based on subtitles; copied here manually, for now>
			|---<files>

For executing/test program, launch:
	vlc\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4\vlc.exe

Currently building with MS Visual Studio 2017 (Version 15.8.7, not sure specific version matters, though)
For modifying dll:
	open this project with MS VisualStudio:  vlc\SpuDecDll-master\SpuDecDll\SpuDecDll.vcxproj
	This step needs to be done only once:
		Highlight the Solution 'SpuDecDll' line in the 'Solution Explorer' window, then click 'File->Save SpuDecDll.sln', then click 'save'.
		Above will save new solution (.sln) file.  Don't bother uploading to git, it can't be loaded directly by others.  But, this sln file can be used to load project from now on.
	Can try building project now... It might report a need to update SDK version; go ahead and update to whatever is on your system.
        	At this point, the build should be successful.  If not... can check a few settings here:
Assuming directory structure above, you will need to make sure the following settings are correct in the Project/Properties:
Include Directories: ..\..\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4\sdk\include\vlc\plugins;
Library Directories:..\..\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4\sdk\lib
Build Events->Post Build Events: copy /y Debug\libspudec_plugin.dll  ..\..\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4\plugins\codec

Build the 'release' version to create a dll that can be copied & used on a computer that does not have Visual Studio installed.

Hopefully useful info:
The DLL (libmovfltr_plugin.dll) contains 3 VLC plugins:
	Audio (MvFiltAudio.c) - This implements actual audio filters, based on input from spudec and demux
	Spudec (MvFiltDemux.c) - This parses subtitles and filter_words file to determine when to mute; sends mute requests to audio plugin
	Demux (spudec.c) - This parses the filter file and will implement skips directly and submit mute requests to audio plugin

VLC can be configured to load & start playing DVD by default.  You can do this with shortcut on desktop by modifying 'target' field to run:
	vlc\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4\vlc.exe dvd:///D:
	Note:  Change "D:" to match whatever your DVD drive letter is.  Also, this could be a network drive mapped to a DVD drive on a different computer.
VLC can also be configured to start in full screen mode by going to Tools->Preferences, and check the 'fullscreen' box on the 'Video' tab.
The libmovfltr_plugin.dll options can be found on the preferences page:
	1.  Click the 'All' button in the Show Settings box on lower left corner
	2.  Scroll down to Input/Codecs section on left and select 'Movie filter'.  Video & Audio filters should be checked (enabled) by default.  Others should not.
		These options can be modified/add/removed as needed.
