Install steps for Development Mode:
1. Create "vlc" folder in some work area on your drive.  Actual location is arbitrary.
2. Download the following packages into the "vlc" folder created above.
	download vlc-3.0.4-win32.7z from http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/vlc/

	github.com/shockeme
	https://github.com/shockeme/SpuDecDll.git
	Look for SpuDecDLL and clone it into your c drive OR download the zip of spudecdll
3. Unzip the packages above in the vlc folder.  This should result in 2 folders inside of the vlc folder:
	SpuDecDll-master
	vlc-3.0.4-win32
4. Temp... until we get install package... Copy the FilterFiles folder (should be on git?) AND the filter_words.txt file into:
	vlc\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4

Directory Structure Should look like:
|--vlc
	|---SpuDecDll-master
		|---Debug <This is where libmovfltr_plugin.dll is created after build>
		|---SpuDecDll
			|---SpuDecDll.vcxproj <if opening .sln file doesn't work, try this one>
			|---<files>
		|---SpuDecDll.sln
		|---SpuDecDLL_Setup.txt <ie. this file>
		|---<files>
	|---vlc-3.04-win32
	        |---vlc-3.0.4
			|---sdk
			|---plugins
				|---codec <This is where libmovfltr_plugin.dll is copied to in post build event>
			|--- vlc.exe <This is THE vlc executable (for development purposes)>
			|--- FilterFiles <Folder that contains all skip and other filter files; copied manually for now>
				|--- MARVELS_THE_AVENGERS.txt <example name of filter file>
			|--- filter_words.txt <Contains all words/phrases to be filter, based on subtitles; copied here manually, for now>
			|---<files>

For executing/test program, launch:
	vlc\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4\vlc.exe

For modifying dll, currently building with MS Visual Studio 2017 (Version 15.8.7, not sure specific version matters, though), open:
	vlc\SpuDecDll-master\SpuDecDll.sln
	if above doesn't work, try:
	vlc\SpuDecDll-master\SpuDecDll\SpuDecDll.vcxproj <== note, after loading this, you'll need to save a new solution (.sln), overwrite original

Assuming directory structure above, you will need to make sure the following settings are correct in the Project/Properties:
Include Directories: ..\..\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4\sdk\include\vlc\plugins;
Library Directories:..\..\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4\sdk\lib
Build Events->Post Build Events: copy /y ..\Debug\libspudec_plugin.dll  ..\..\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4\plugins\codec

The DLL (libmovfltr_plugin.dll) contains 3 VLC plugins:
	Audio (MvFiltAudio.c) - This implements actual audio filters, based on input from spudec and demux
	Spudec (MvFiltDemux.c) - This parses subtitles and filter_words file to determine when to mute; sends mute requests to audio plugin
	Demux (spudec.c) - This parses the filter file and will implement skips directly and submit mute requests to audio plugin

VLC can be configured to load & start playing DVD by default.  You can do this with shortcut on desktop by modifying 'target' field to run:
	vlc\vlc-3.0.4-win32\vlc-3.0.4\vlc.exe dvd:///D:
	Note:  Change "D:" to match whatever your DVD drive letter is.  Also, this could be a network drive mapped to a DVD drive on a different computer.
VLC can also be configured to start in full screen mode by going to Tools->Preferences, and check the 'fullscreen' box on the 'Video' tab.
The libmovfltr_plugin.dll options can be found on the preferences page:
	1.  Click the 'All' button in the Show Settings box on lower left corner
	2.  Scroll down to Input/Codecs section on left and select 'Movie filter'.  Video & Audio filters should be checked (enabled) by default.  Others should not.
		These options can be modified/add/removed as needed.
